## Configuration Settings

### Disable Turn Prompts

To avoid frequent and potentially distracting alerts during navigation, especially in areas with many bends or curves (e.g., forest trails), it is advisable to disable the Turn Prompts feature. This prevents the device from issuing sound alerts ahead of bends or curves.

**App Configuration:**

```
Device -> Forerunner 965 -> Navigation -> Alerts -> Turn Prompts: Off
```

**Watch Configuration:**

```
Settings -> Navigation -> Alerts -> Turn Prompts: Off
```

### Course Recalculation When Off Course

For running activities, to ensure that the device closely adheres to the planned course without recalculating a new route to the final destination upon deviation, adjust the following setting.

**App Configuration:**

```
Device -> Forerunner 965 -> Activities & Apps -> Run -> Routing -> Courses: Follow Course
```

**Watch Configuration:**

```
Settings -> Activities & Apps -> Run -> Run Settings -> Routing -> Courses: Follow Course
```

```

**Watch Configuration:**

```
Settings -> Navigation -> Alerts -> Off Course: On
